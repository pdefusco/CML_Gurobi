# CML Gurobi

## Objective

Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) is a platform designed to help organizations build, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. It is part of Clouderaâ€™s suite of enterprise data platforms and solutions, focusing on providing a robust environment for data scientists, analysts, and engineers to collaborate on end-to-end machine learning workflows.

PyGurobi is a Python interface for the Gurobi Optimizer, a powerful and widely used solver for mathematical optimization problems. Gurobi is known for its high performance in solving a variety of optimization problems, including linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), and others.

In this tutorial you will use PyGurobi on CML in order to optimize product prices and maximize enterprise revenue.

## Requirements

The following are required in order to reproduce this example:

* CML Workspace in AWS, Azure, OCP or ECS.
* Basic knowledge of Python for Machine Learning including Sci-Kit Learn, Spark, Iceberg, and XGBoost.
* Basic familiarity with linear and non linear programming. If you are new to mathematical optimization please visit this link for a [quick introduction](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/k12/optimization/MO-unit3-pdfs/3.4buildingsimplex.pdf).
